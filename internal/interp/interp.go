// Package interp implements spec §3.8 interpolation: `${<fieldpath>}` inside a
// string scalar resolves against the merged projectfile document.
//
// What we are trying to do: let a SHARED include fragment carry a value that
// resolves differently in every document that includes it. One badge row in
// m6e/core reaches 125 projects because `${license.spdx}` is read from the
// consumer's own document at render time, not from the fragment.
//
// The address grammar is the existing pf-cli one (internal/fieldpath), so there
// is no second syntax to learn and no string surgery anywhere: `${identity.name}`,
// `${links[type=source-code].url}`, `${org.projectfile.forge.remotes.codeberg.owner}`
// all work, including keys that themselves contain dots.
//
// Anything that is not a resolvable field address is left VERBATIM. That is the
// clause that makes cohabitation work: `${B19_DOCKER_REGISTRY}` is a make
// variable, not a field, so it survives untouched for m6e to resolve later, and
// a `{MATRIX_AXIS}` placeholder carries no `$` at all.
//
// # Scopes
//
// A reference resolves from the document ROOT. ExpandIn adds SCOPES: addresses
// whose subtree is searched first, in order, before the root. That is the whole
// difference between a template nobody can read and one somebody writes:
//
//	ExpandIn(doc, tmpl, "me.dbuho.projectfile.image")
//	  "${org}-${name}-${series}"  →  "b19-ubuntu-resolute"
//
// It is also what lets ONE template compose a FOREIGN subject. The same string
// aimed at a different scope address answers about a different thing — which is
// how a build resolves a base image belonging to another project without this
// package knowing that images, registries or projects exist.
//
// A scope carries no vocabulary. It is an address the CALLER supplies, so
// nothing here knows what lives under it.
